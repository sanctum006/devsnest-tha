    <h1>A Thank You Letter To a Great Community Mentor!!</h1>

    <h3>Devsnest Mentor,</h3>

    <p>
      Your excellent community and amazing peer learning concept has helped me
      tremendously through my journey at Devsnest. Without your helpfulness and
      directness, the journey would have been more challenging. I appreciate you
      being stern and letting me know what I am doing wrong along with giving my
      ways I can correct my mistakes.
      <br />
      It is comforting to know that whenever I have a question you answer right
      away, which you know is all the time. I like that you refer to your
      personal work-related situations as examples when teaching a lesson along
      with a regular course outline. I have learned so much from you and I look
      forward to learning more. Thank you for being a remarkable teacher and I
      am very grateful to have you as a teacher.
    </p>

    <h4>Sincerely,</h4>
    <h4>sanctum</h4>
